1. Create a new DataAdapter for the given data
	* It does not need to have a specific name but following the convetion will probably make it easier for future changes
	* It does need to have certain code parts
		- Extend DataAdapter class (see row 1 in any of the other data type adapters)
		- have a method called getObservation(this,paths) that returns a Observation object (again see how the other classes does it)	

2. Update the GUI to provide user input for loading and managing
	* Add case statement in loaddatastep2-->updateSource function
	* Add new button and text in loaddatastep2 for new data, also callback for button
	* Add new radiobutton and corresponding callback function in ImportWindow
	* Add a if-statement for the new type in ímportWindow --> okBtn_callback and update length of types in the same function

3. Register the new DataAdapter in AdapterFactory by following the pattern for the other datatypes

4. Add all the new variables to behavior_variables

5. Change Constants accordingly
